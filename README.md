NYC_Crime_Wave_Study

By Charlene Thomas

In light of the conversations around returning to work, subway shootings, hate crimes and a rising "Covid Crime Wave", the project uses NYPD's Recorded Crimes data, provided through the NYC OpenData Portal, to call into question the public's concerns and the overall safety of the city. 

The project evaluates the following questions: Is there enough evidence to say that NYC is currently in a "Crime Wave"? What were some of the largest fluctuations in the types of felony crime in and since 2020? Is there evidence of an Asian Hate Crime Wave since 2020? 

By exploring this data, the findings can be used to help employees address their concerns, to develop Return to Work/Work from Home/Hybrid policies in the workplace and to evaluate the system by which the NYPD records hate crimes.
